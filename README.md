Emojis: ⚡️ 🔄 🌀 📦 🧭

Welcome to a comprehensive guide for the Loading Indicator library for React Native. This project provides native loading indicators that blend seamlessly with your React Native apps. The goal is to give you fast, smooth, customizable spinners that feel native on both iOS and Android. This README is designed to be practical and developer-focused, with concrete instructions, solid examples, and thoughtful guidance on usage, accessibility, testing, and maintenance.

Below you’ll find a thorough collection of topics. It is meant to be readable by developers new to React Native and by teams that want a reliable component for long-running operations, network requests, or any task that benefits from a visual cue of ongoing work. The content is kept in plain language, with clear steps and concrete code examples. The library is built to be stable, predictable, and easy to integrate into existing projects.

Overview and goals
- Native feel: The indicators render with native performance and rely on platform-appropriate animation primitives.
- High performance: The indicators minimize re-renders and avoid heavy animation loops when not visible.
- Flexible styling: Size, color, and shape can be tuned to fit your brand and design system.
- Accessible by default: Screen readers get meaningful labels, and interactive elements expose proper roles.
- Cross-platform consistency: Spinners behave similarly on iOS and Android while honoring platform conventions.

This repository uses a simple component model that you can plug into any React Native screen. The API surface aims to be small but powerful, giving you enough control to craft subtle or bold loading states without reimplementing your own visuals. The library is designed to be tree-shakeable, so unused indicators and features don’t bloat your bundle.

Quick facts
- Native rendering: Spinners use platform-native UI primitives to feel integrated with each platform.
- Small API surface: A few props to customize size, color, and variant.
- Common variants: Circular, Linear, and Pulse indicators to cover a range of use cases.
- Theming support: Integrate with your design system via theme-aware props or a theme provider.
- Accessible: Accessible labels are automatically generated when you provide a description.

Let’s explore how to use Loading Indicator in your React Native project.

Getting started: installation and usage
Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or newer recommended)
- React Native environment set up per your platform
- Basic knowledge of React Native components and styling

Installation
- Install via npm:
  - npm install loading-indicator
- Or via yarn:
  - yarn add loading-indicator

After installation
- Link native dependencies if your project uses an older React Native version that requires manual linking.
- Clean and rebuild your app to ensure native modules are properly integrated.

Usage overview
- Import the indicator component from the library.
- Use it in your React Native view tree where you need a loading state.
- Adjust appearance with size, color, and variant props.

Basic usage example (JavaScript)
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import LoadingIndicator from 'loading-indicator';

const LoaderExample = () => (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <LoadingIndicator size={40} color="#4F8AFF" variant="circular" />
  </View>
);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

export default LoaderExample;

Basic usage example (TypeScript)
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import LoadingIndicator from 'loading-indicator';

type Props = {
  loading?: boolean;
  size?: number;
  color?: string;
  variant?: 'circular' | 'linear' | 'pulse';
};

export const IndicatorDemo: React.FC<Props> = ({ loading = true, size = 48, color = '#4F8AFF', variant = 'circular' }) => {
  if (!loading) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.wrapper}>
      <LoadingIndicator size={size} color={color} variant={variant} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  wrapper: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 16,
  },
});

export default IndicatorDemo;

APIs and props
- size: number
  - Controls the visual size of the indicator in density-independent pixels (dp).
  - Typical values: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64.
- color: string
  - Sets the indicator color. Accepts standard color formats (hex, rgb, named colors).
- variant: 'circular' | 'linear' | 'pulse'
  - Selects the visual style of the indicator. Each variant has its own animation pattern and aesthetic.
- accessibilityLabel: string (React Native accessibility prop)
  - Defines a descriptive label for assistive technology.
- style: StyleProp<ViewStyle>
  - Lets you apply container styling to wrap the indicator.

Variant details and usage
- Circular
  - A classic round spinner. Smooth, looped rotation. Works well in most places where a compact indicator is needed.
- Linear
  - A straight progress or shimmer bar. Useful for indicating ongoing progress in a narrow area like a header or near a list item.
- Pulse
  - A pulsating dot or bar that signals activity without a full rotation. Great for subtle loading cues where full spinners feel too bold.

Theming and design system integration
- You can pass color values directly to color prop or integrate with a theming solution.
- If you use a ThemeProvider, you can map theme colors to the color prop, ensuring consistent visuals across your app.
- For advanced use cases, expose a theme-aware variant that reads from a shared design token set.

Platform notes and performance considerations
- iOS
  - Uses UIActivityIndicatorView under the hood to leverage native performance and look.
  - Animations are throttled to stay smooth and battery-friendly.
- Android
  - Uses ProgressBar or equivalent native components for efficient rendering.
  - The implementation ensures minimal impact on main thread scheduling.
- Performance tips
  - Avoid rendering multiple indicators in a tight loop; render one visible indicator and keep others offscreen or unmounted during loading.
  - Prefer stable and bounded sizes to reduce layout thrashing.
  - Use the minimal color depth needed to achieve your design goal; deep color palettes don’t add overhead here.

Accessibility and inclusive design
- All indicators come with a default accessibilityLabel that describes the nature of the indicator.
- You can customize the label to reflect the specific operation, e.g., "Loading data, please wait" or "Fetching user profile".
- If the loader is used in a critical flow, provide a descriptive label and, where appropriate, an aria-live region or equivalent to communicate progress or status.

Theming and design system integration details
- Theme support
  - Your app’s theme can drive the color prop so that infers the correct color per page or component.
  - A global theme object can map tokens like brandPrimary, brandSecondary, and neutral to color values used by the indicators.
- Token usage example
  - const color = theme.tokens.brandPrimary;
  - <LoadingIndicator size={28} color={color} variant="circular" />

Animation and customization
- You can customize the animation duration indirectly by tuning the size and variant; some combinations will derive faster or slower perceived motion.
- If you need a bespoke animation not covered by the built-in variants, you can fork the library and add a new variant that implements a custom Animated loop.
- For precise animation control, you can introduce an ExternalAnimation component that drives the indicator’s transform via Animated.Value; this is an advanced pattern that can be adapted to your specific requirements.

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests for UI components can be implemented with React Native Testing Library and Jest.
- Snapshot tests can help guard against regressions in the UI while ensuring that size and color props render correctly.
- End-to-end testing can verify loading states in real device environments using Detox or Appium.
- Visual testing can help guard against regressions in animation smoothness across devices.

Example tests (conceptual)
- Snapshot test to verify default rendering matches the expected layout.
- Interaction test to ensure that the loading indicator remains visible while a mock fetch operation updates a loading prop.
- Accessibility test to verify the presence of an accessibilityLabel when the loader is mounted.

FAQ
- How does this library differ from other spinners?
  - It emphasizes native feel, simplicity, and performance. It is designed to be easy to integrate into a React Native app without heavy animation logic on the JavaScript side.
- Can I use this in Web or React Native Web?
  - The primary focus is native React Native. If you need web support, you may adapt it with CI-compatible tooling, but the built-in assets target native platforms.
- How do I customize the spinner color to match my brand?
  - Pass the color prop with any valid color code. You can also wire in your theme tokens for consistent brand usage.

Troubleshooting tips
- If the loader does not render, ensure the component is mounted and visible in the view. Check for conditional rendering that might skip the loader when a condition is true.
- If there is a layout shift when the loader appears, ensure the surrounding container has a stable size and that you are not forcing conflicting layout changes at the same time.
- If you see a warning about missing accessibility labels, supply an accessibilityLabel prop with a meaningful description.
